В мире распространённость самоубийств с использованием огнестрельного оружия колеблется в широких пределах, в зависимости от доступности огнестрельного оружия и его культурного восприятия. Применение огнестрельного оружия при самоубийстве колеблется от менее 10 % в Австралии[29] до 53,7 % в США, и в настоящее время является наиболее распространенным способом самоубийства в мире[30].\r\n\r\nНеудачная попытка суицида может привести к хроническим болям, снижению умственной способности, двигательных функций, кровоизлиянию в мозг, проникновению осколков в черепную коробку, а также может спровоцировать пневмоцефалию и утечку спинномозговой жидкости (англ.). Нелетальный выстрел в височную кость может вызвать височный абсцесс, менингит, афазию, гемианопсию, гемиплегию, а также общие внутричерепные осложнения. 50 % людей, выживших после выстрела в височную кость, страдают от повреждения лицевого нерва, как правило, из-за его разрыва[31][32].\r\n\r\nИсследование, опубликованное в «New England Journal of Medicine and the National Academy of Science», выявило связь между хранением огнестрельного оружия в домашнем хозяйстве и частотой самоубийств с его использованием[33][34], однако в исследовании Миллера Хеменве не найдено статистически значимой связи между домашним хранением огнестрельного оружия и самоубийством[35], за исключением случаев суицида детей 5-14 лет[35]. В течение 1980-х и начала 1990-х годов наблюдалась выраженная тенденция подростковых самоубийств с использованием оружия[36], а также резкий всплеск количества суицидов, совершённых лицами 75 и более лет[37].\r\n\r\nДва отдельных исследования, проведённых в Канаде и Австралии с более строгим ограничительным, относительно огнестрельного оружия, законодательством, показали, что в то время как количество самоубийств с использованием огнестрельного оружия снижается, использование других методов, таких, как повешение, увеличивается. В Австралии общее количество самоубийств продолжало повышаться, пока не были реализованы меры, направленные на обеспечение поддержки людей, выразивших намерение совершить самоубийство[38][39][40]."}, "commit"=>"Create Post"}

В мире распространённость самоубийств с использованием огнестрельного оружия колеблется в широких пределах, в зависимости от доступности огнестрельного оружия и его культурного восприятия. Применение огнестрельного оружия при самоубийстве колеблется от менее 10 % в Австралии[29] до 53,7 % в США, и в настоящее время является наиболее распространенным способом самоубийства в мире[30].\r\n\r\nНеудачная попытка суицида может привести к хроническим болям, снижению умственной способности, двигательных функций, кровоизлиянию в мозг, проникновению осколков в черепную коробку, а также может спровоцировать пневмоцефалию и утечку спинномозговой жидкости (англ.). Нелетальный выстрел в височную кость может вызвать височный абсцесс, менингит, афазию, гемианопсию, гемиплегию, а также общие внутричерепные осложнения. 50 % людей, выживших после выстрела в височную кость, страдают от повреждения лицевого нерва, как правило, из-за его разрыва[31][32].\r\n\r\nИсследование, опубликованное в «New England Journal of Medicine and the National Academy of Science», выявило связь между хранением огнестрельного оружия в домашнем хозяйстве и частотой самоубийств с его использованием[33][34], однако в исследовании Миллера Хеменве не найдено статистически значимой связи между домашним хранением огнестрельного оружия и самоубийством[35], за исключением случаев суицида детей 5-14 лет[35]. В течение 1980-х и начала 1990-х годов наблюдалась выраженная тенденция подростковых самоубийств с использованием оружия[36], а также резкий всплеск количества суицидов, совершённых лицами 75 и более лет[37].\r\n\r\nДва отдельных исследования, проведённых в Канаде и Австралии с более строгим ограничительным, относительно огнестрельного оружия, законодательством, показали, что в то время как количество самоубийств с использованием огнестрельного оружия снижается, использование других методов, таких, как повешение, увеличивается. В Австралии общее количество самоубийств продолжало повышаться, пока не были реализованы меры, направленные на обеспечение поддержки людей, выразивших намерение совершить самоубийство[38][39][40]."], ["created_at", "2018-11-22 19:34:36.632172"], ["updated_at", "2018-11-22 19:34:36.632172"]]
